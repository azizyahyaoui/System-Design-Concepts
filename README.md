# 🧠 System Design Concepts

Welcome to my curated collection of system design fundamentals. This repository serves as my personal knowledge base, where I distill complex concepts into digestible notes and examples. It's a work in progress, evolving as I deepen my understanding and explore new areas.

## 📂 What's Inside

* **GoldenBrickV1.md**: My initial framework for approaching system design problems. It outlines key principles and strategies that I find essential.
* **System design.md**: A compilation of core concepts, patterns, and best practices in system design. This includes topics like scalability, availability, and fault tolerance. ([Reddit][1])

## 🛠️ Topics Covered

* Scalability and Load Balancing
* Caching Strategies
* Database Sharding and Replication
* CAP Theorem and Consistency Models
* Message Queues and Event-Driven Architecture
* API Gateway and Service Discovery
* Rate Limiting and Throttling
* Microservices vs Monoliths
* Disaster Recovery and Fault Tolerance
* Security Considerations in System Design([GitHub][2], [ByteByteGo Blog][3])

These topics are inspired by industry standards and resources like [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer), [ByteByteGo](https://github.com/ByteByteGoHq/system-design-101).([GitHub][4]) and also [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2FmTdLtb_4)

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is my sandbox for experimenting with system design ideas. It's where I document my learning journey, capture insights, and refine my understanding. While it's tailored to my learning style, I hope others find value in it too.

## 🤝 Contributions

While this is a personal project, I'm open to feedback and discussions. If you have suggestions or spot something that could be improved, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
